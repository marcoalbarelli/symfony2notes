symfony2notes
=============

A Symfony project created on July 8, 2015, 2:38 pm.

This project serves two purposes: 
* collecting all the best practices I use in developing  Symfony2 projects
* provide a ready-to-use set of boilerplate code for the usual scenarios

Setup
=====

Setup db connection for making tests pass

Tests rely on a %database_name%_test database, so be sure to create that one too

---

This project will progress in bursts, depending on my workload
